# Physics Laboratory Reports

## üìú Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of physics laboratory reports completed during my Foundation year. These reports document experiments conducted in the Physics module.

Each experiment was meticulously documented in a lab book, following rigorous guidelines, to ensure that another engineer with relevant knowledge could reproduce the experiment and its results. Key aspects of this methodology included:
* Clear statement of **aims** and relevant **background theory**.
* Detailed **methodology** with diagrams of experimental setups.
* Systematic recording of **results and calculations**, including error analysis and clear presentation in tables/graphs.
* Thoughtful **conclusions** reflecting on the aims, expected results, and potential improvements.
All entries were made contemporaneously, with any errors crossed out and explained, adhering to professional engineering practice.

### Methodology & Collaboration

This project was conducted in two distinct phases:

* **Experimental Phase:** The hands-on setup of the experiment and the collection of raw data were performed collaboratively with a lab partner, **[Daniel Anisoreac]** - GitHub: **[@DAnisoreac](https://github.com/DAnisoreac)**

* **Analysis and Reporting Phase:** The processing of the collected data, all scientific analysis, interpretation of results, and the writing of this lab report are **my own original and individual work.**
